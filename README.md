## Hi my sudo name is 'atloti', this is pronounced At-lo-tee.

I am a developer, attending uni and am just now working my way into blockchain. I wanted to find a small place to work and develop.

I remain secret in my day to day life and would prefer to remain this way.

I like the programing languages Java, Scala, Javascript and C++
